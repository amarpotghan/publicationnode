This is a NodeJS AngularJs POC.

1. NodeJS
NodeJS server is nothing but a Json API(REST), listens on the port 3001.
Server has following folder structure.

lib/
routes/
test/
views/
app.js
router.js
start.js
Makefile
package.json

1. Start.js

This is a config script to start and configure node application. We have saparated out config from start file. Also we have maintained routers logic in the router.js file so that
it is now easily maintainable.

2.app.js

This is a NodeJs/ExpressJS Application configuration file. It configures app with fllowing parameters:
    a. Static Directory Path
    b. Server PORT
    c. Logger
    d. router
    e. Post request body parser
    f. ErrorHandler
    g. Server

3. router.js

Every server request is routed through this class. This handles various server requests. For now it handles three requests.

 1. Login (url='/api/login')
 2. TreeStructure (url='/api/treeStruct')
 3. DirectoryToJson (url='/api/getDirectory')

 Responsibility of router is to route request listened by server to various routes. In here...

 '/api/login','/api/treeStruct/','/api/getDirectory' requests are handled by DirectoryRouter.

 4. Routes
    -ApiRouter.js
        This is a router to handle all api requests. This again calls desired service to compute response.

 5. lib/Services
    -DirectoryToJson.js
        This service creates Json object of given directory using Directory model.

 6. Tests
    This contains all the BDD and TDD tests. Mocha (Unit testing Framework for NodeJS is configured to run the tests)
